            So you want to know about me?, Alright, I will try to not bore you.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you know my name is Himanshu Bansal (Written on landing page, duh).A <span id="age"></span> old engineer by brain, gamer by nature.
            From a very young age i want to become an engineer and i will continue to be one, not only software or hardware just engineer. I think of my self as <b>master of all trade but master of none</b> because i can't find that one thing that i want to master so i try everything technology have to offer ever since. 
          </p>
          <p>
            For me Engineer is a person who solves peoples problem by any means necessary and thats what i do. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I am not from south India or from Africa, I am born and raised in Delhi, India and have been with my parents.
          </p>
          <p>
            For my hobbies, Love to code,watch Anime and play games(too much), sometimes watch action movies, comedy shows or read books (usually sleeps after reading few pages but still read them). Can you beat you in a spice eating competition And like to travel where internet is fast. And lastly NOT A FAN OF GAME OF THRONE (ðŸ˜²)
